near-surface (usually, 2 meter) air temperature; the CMOR singleton dimension default value of 2 m can be overridden, if absolutely necessary, by redefining axis "height1".

kg m-2

water in all phases summed over all soil layers, and averaged over the land portion of the grid cell (i.e., compute by dividing the total mass of water contained in the soil layer of the grid cell by the land area in the grid cell); report as "missing" or 0.0 where the land fraction is 0.

this thickness when multiplied by the average area of the grid cell covered by snow yields the time-mean snow volume.  Thus, for time means, compute as the weighted sum of thickness (averaged over the snow-covered portion of the grid cell) divided by the sum of the weights, with the weights equal to the area covered by snow.  report as 0.0 in snow-free regions.
